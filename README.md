# K_portfolio

Welcome on my portfolio.
My name is Kevin TONOU EWA. I'm a worker in the finance industry and I found a passion for business intelligence tools a year ago.
Ever since, I started seaching online any source of information that can help me statisfy my curiosity. Then I booked an online course,
which is the Google data analysis cetification. Here is what I'm capable of for now. My goal is to work fool time as a data analyst or any job related to data analysis.
